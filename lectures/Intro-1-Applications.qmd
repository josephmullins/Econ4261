## Overview
We have to review some **core tools/ideas** in statistics:

- Basics of distributions, populations vs sample. Mean, variance, etc
- Sample mean $\rightarrow$ large sample theory $\rightarrow$ population mean (estimation)
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
- Linear models and linear regression 

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
First, some research to motivate us.

## Application 1: Credit Constraints and Human Capital {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- "The Nature of Credit Constraints and Human Capital", Lochner and Monge-Naranjo, American Economic Review (2011) 
- **Theory**: 
  - Incomplete markets can lead to underinvestment in human capital (agents cannot borrow against returns to investment). 
  - Controlling for returns, income/wealth should not predict investment unless borrowing constraints bind.
- **Question**: Evidence of credit constraints in college enrollment decisions? 
- **Data** NLSY79 and NLSY 97 (two cohorts of young individuals) 
- **Key idea**: How do skills (measured by AFQT) and parental income predict college enrollment?

- Consistent gradient in AFQT (cog skill)
- Family income more important in 97 cohort
- Suggestive evidence of more binding constraints \pause
- No testing here: how to test formally?

## Application 2: Teacher Incentives in Rural India

:::{.incremental}
- **Paper**: "Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School", Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan, American Economic Review (2012) 
- **Background**: expanding access to primary education crucial in developing countries. Teacher absenteeism in India is a big problem. 
- **Theory**: providing incentives should increase attendance. 
- **The Paper**: evaluates a teacher incentive program by RCT.  
- Data: Attendance and student outcomes for 57 treatment schools, 56 control schools run by Seva Mandir (NGO)

## Application 2: Teacher Incentives in Rural India {.smaller}
Details on "treatment":

:::{.incremental}
- Monitoring via tamper-proof cameras. 
- Financial incentives for teachers:
    $$ \text{Rupees per month} = 500 + 50\times\max\{0,D - 10\} $$
    where $D$ is days attended per month. 
- Financial incentives or fear of punishment? 
- **Notice**: no incentive if:
    $$ \text{Days attended so far} + \text{Days left in month} \leq 10 $$
