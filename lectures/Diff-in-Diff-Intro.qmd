## Introduction

:::{.incremental}
- Previously: how to estimate "causal effects" when treatments are randomly offered to individuals.
- Can we ever do this in non-experimental settings? 
- With additional assumptions, we can try. 
- We'll now explore the method of **difference-in-differences**, which infers causality by making a particular modelling assumption for conditional means.
:::

## Example 1: Medicaid Expansion

:::{.incremental}
- Consider the Medicaid Expansion introduced by the ACA
    - Increased eligiblity of individuals for public health insurance
- Some states adopted, some states did not.
- Let $Y_{st}$ be all-cause mortality in state $s$ at time $t$.
- Suppose we have data on two states $s\in\{1,2\}$ in $T=10$ periods. 
- Suppose that only state 2 adopts the expansion in period 5...

    mutate(y = 1 + 0.005*rnorm(10) )

    geom_vline(xintercept=5,linetype="dashed") + 
    ylab("All-cause Mortality (per 1000 persons)") + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + transition_reveal(t,keep_last = TRUE)

## Example 2: COVID policies and education outcomes

:::{.incremental}
- When covid hit, states adopted different policies with regards to school closures.
- Let $Y_{pt}$ be average standardized math score for students in districts with policy $p$ in year $t$. 
- Suppose we compare districts that remained fully in person to those that went fully remote...

    mutate(y = -0.1 + 0.005*rnorm(10) - 0.025*pmin(3,pmax(t-2020,0)))
rbind(d0,d1) %>%
    rename(year = t) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=year,y=y,color=Case)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + transition_reveal(year,keep_last = TRUE)

## Simplest Setup: Two units, two periods

:::{.incremental}
- Let $j$ index treatment units $j\in\{1,2\}$
- Let $t$ index periods $t\in\{1,2\}$
- Let $Y(p)$ be the **potential outcome** of interest where $p\in\{0,1\}$ indicates treatment
- Let $P(j,t)\in\{0,1\}$ indicate whether the policy is in place. Here:
$$ P(1,1)=P(1,2) = 0\ \text{and}\ P(2,1)=0,\ P(2,2) = 1 $$
- So policy introduced in unit 2 in period 2.
:::

## Simplest Setup: assumptions

:::{.incremental}
- Recall that causal inference is all about making assumptions to construct a **counterfactual**
- Here, that is given by the **parallel trends** assumption: that average differences in $Y(0)$ between the untreated ($j=1$) and treated ($j=2$) units are stable over time
- Define $Y_{jt}(p) = \mathbb{E}[Y(p)|j,t]$
- Math:
$$ Y_{2t}(0) - Y_{1t}(0) = \text{constant for all}\ t $$
:::

## Simplest Setup: Causal Inference

We want:
$$ ATT = Y_{22}(1) - Y_{22}(0) $$

. . . 

Use parallel trends to calculate the counterfactual:

$$ Y_{22}(0) = Y_{12}(0) + Y_{21}(0) - Y_{11}(0) $$

. . . 

So:
$$ \begin{multline} ATT = \mathbb{E}[Y|j=2,t=2] - \mathbb{E}[Y|j=1,t=2] \\ - (\mathbb{E}[Y|j=2,t=1]-\mathbb{E}[Y|j=1,t=1]) \end{multline} $$

Hence the name: **difference-in-differences**.

## Graphical Intuition

## Example: Minimum Wages

:::{.incremental}
- Do higher minimum wages decrease employment?
- Card and Krueger (1994) consider impact of New Jersey's 1992 minimum wage increase from \$4.25 to \$5.05 per hour.
- Compare employment in 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after rise.
- Use survey data on employment and wages from two waves:
  - March 92 - one month before min wage increase
  - Dec 92 - eight months after
:::

## Estimation and Inference

:::{.incremental}
- Estimation is straightforward in the $2\times2$ case (exercise)
- Let's work out inference in two cases:
    1. Each unit and time period has an independent sample
    2. Individuals in each unit are observed in both periods

## Card \& Krueger Results

## Card \& Krueger Results

:::{.incremental}
- Card \& Krueger find **no significant effect** of minimum wage on employment. 
- Are you satisfied with this evidence? Any potential issues? 
- This paper sparked a decades-long empirical debate. Still no resolution. 
- Depends who you read, what specification you use, which outcomes you look at, who you look at. 
- Most recent: Seattle minimum wage study - two groups of researchers finding conflicting results. 
- Krueger was Assistant Secretary of Treasury and chair of Obama's CEA.
