# Racial Bias in Callbacks

## 

![](/figures/BM-abstract.png)

## Paper Summary

:::{.incremental}
- **Big question**: is there racial discrimination in the labor market?
    - Correlations *uninformative*: legacy of institutional racism leads to differences in education, opportunities, and human capital
- This paper: measures a specific kind of discrimination. Callbacks based on name (which can signify race)
- Methodology: Randomize names on job application to infer effect of changing "black sounding" name to "white sounding"
    - Often referred to as a *field experiment*
:::

## Design of the Experiment {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Start by collecting resumes from two job search sites
    - restrict to cities and time of experiment
    - restrict to four occupations (sales, clerical, customer services, admin)
    - classify subjectively into two categories (high vs low quality)
- Generate a pool of names
    - Use all birth certificates from MA: 1974-1979
    - Tabulate frequency by race to get most uniquely white/black names
    - Validate with survey
- Survey job ads and manually pick two high and two low quality resumes that best fit job description
    - Randomly assign one white name and one black name to each resume of same quality
    - Measure **callbacks** for each resume
- Respond to 1300 job ads with nearly 5000 resumes. What next? What would it tell us? Why?

# The Effect of Ban the Box on Racial Discrimination

## Application 2: Ban the Box

- **Ban the Box**: law that makes it illegal for employers to ask job applicants if they have ever been convicted of a crime.
- **Intention**: reduce labor market discrimination against individuals with criminal priors
- Due to mass incarceration and other discriminatory policies, black men have higher rates of prior conviction than white men
- Possible consequence: increase discrimination against black men *without* prior conviction (form of statistical discrimination)

## Paper Summary
  
:::{.incremental}
- **Main question**: is there labor market discrimination against males with prior conviction? Does BTB increase racial discrimination?
- Another "resume study"
- Randomized resumes in NY and NJ *before* and *after* introduction of BTB in both states
:::


## Methodology {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}  
- **Population**: 
    - private and for-profit employers on indeed.com and snagajob.com
    - jobs requiring no post-secondary education, special skills, or work experience (e.g. retail and restaurant)
    - Pre and post BTB introduction in 2015
- On otherwise identical resumes, randomized along four dimensions: 
    (1) race (by name); 
    (2) a non-violent and minor felony conviction; 
    (3) employment gap in resume; and 
    (4) GED or High school diploma
- 15,220 applications to 4,291 stores among 293 chains
- Now what?

## Regression Framework {.smaller}

Store $j$ for applicant $i$:
  $$ Callback_{ij} = \alpha +  \beta_{1} Box_{j} + \beta_{2}White_{i} + \beta_{3}Box_{j}\times White_{i} + \Gamma \mathbf{X}_{i} + \epsilon_{ij} $$

:::{.incremental}
- Which coefficient captures the effect of box info on racial gap? 
- What values would suggest that employers use race to proxy for criminal conviction? 
- Cross-sectional and temporal sources of variation in $Box_{j}$ 
- Limit either to pre BTB (cross-sectional) or stores that initially have box (temporal)

Thoughts? How do you think standard errors should be calculated?
