# Brief Introduction

About me:

- I'm an Assistant Professor in the econ dept. \pause
- My research is on the development of skills ("human capital") in early childhood and how it can be shaped by policy
- I also study labor markets and the determinants of income inequality. \pause
- Email: [mullinsj\@umn.edu](mailto:mullinsj@umn.edu?subject=Econ4261) (use ECON4621 in subject)


## This Course - What is Econometrics? {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

Economics

- Provides normative and positive theories of social phenomena
- Markets are everywhere
- More broadly: choice behavior under constraints

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment .fade-left}

Econometrics

- Tools for mapping theory $\rightarrow$ data
- Data/world fundamentally uncertain
- Must make *probabilistic* statements about theories, parameters
- Model + Data $\rightarrow$ Policy

:::

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Will learn tools rigorously analyse data and map data to policy

# R language

- `R` is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It's free and open source
- You can do a lot with it
- RStudio: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
- Introduction:  <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf>
- I will provide lots of examples to help you learn

## Assessment Plan {.smaller}

Three components of assessment (see syllabus on Canvas / Website for dates):

:::{.incremental}
- [Writing project](/assignments/GroupProject.qmd) (20\%)
  - A written report that uses data to answer an economic question
  - Presentation of results in class
  - The analysis will be conducted in groups, reports will be written **individually**
- Assignments (40\%).
  - Five total, will count highest four.
  - Some theory exercises. Some applications in `R`.
  - Get you used to data and programming. **Very important**.
- Midterm and Final (20\% each). **Midterm: February 29 in class**.
:::

# Submission Guidelines

Keep the following in mind for submitting homework:

- Must be submitted as a `Quarto` or `R` notebook.
  - **Will see how to write these in recitation**
- For theory questions, you can submit additional handwritten answers, but they must be scanned to **pdf format**
- Your TA has permission to deduct grades for illegible submissions.


# How to do well in this class

- To do well, you need a deep understanding of the tools and to be able to think independently with them.
- Come to class, make sure you **really** understand the exercises we do.
- Will provide exercises to test your understanding.
- Use recitation to help you learn programming in `R` and data work.

## Econometrics at work: labor supply example

## Issues to work through

Our tools will answer these questions

:::{.incremental}
- How can we estimate the parameters of this model?
- How uncertain are we about the estimates?
- How does this uncertainty change as we get more data?
- Is the estimate sufficiently far from null (i.e. 0)?
- Is the relationship we have found **causal**?
- Can we extrapolate to a policy effect?
:::

## Application - Inequality, Institutions, and Policies {.smaller}

Much work in econ dedicated to answering questions around inequality and social policy:

:::{.incremental}
- What kinds of inequality in outcomes exists?
  - Income and wealth
  - Health
  - Incarceration
- Is there inequality of opportunity?
  - Early childhood and family
  - Education
  - Labor market
  - Judicial
- What are **causal** mechanisms? 
- What can policy do? What are unintended consequences?
:::

## Diagnosis - What kinds of inequality of opportunity? {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60% }
![](/figures/Currie.png)
:::

::: {.column width=40%}

- Strong relationship between test scores and later-life outcomes.
- Strong relationship between birth weight and later-life outcomes.
- These proxy for quality of early childhood environment.

## Diagnosis - What kinds of inequality of opportunity? {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60% }
![](/figures/Chetty.png)
:::

::: {.column width=40%}

- What does this graph tell us about economic mobility in U.S?
- How could we use this to learn about what determines mobility?

:::
::::

## Which relationships are causal?
Questions:

:::{.incremental}
- What are mechanisms of inequality?
- Which observed relationships are causal?
- What policies have an effect?
- When can policy effects be inferred? Need a model.
:::

## Inferring Causality: Neighborhoods {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60% }
![](/figures/ChettyHendren_causal.png)
:::

::: {.column width=40%}

:::{.incremental}
- Using *within-family variation* in exposure to neighborhoods.
- Weaker assumption for causal inference than pure cross-section.
- What do you think?
:::

::::

## Inferring Causality: Head Start {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60% }
![](/figures/HS_event_study.png)
:::

::: {.column width=40%}

- Head Start introduced in some counties before others.
- Use *within-county variation* in exposure Head Start.
- Evidence: long-run impacts of Head Start.

**Difference-in-differences**

::::

## Inferring Causality: Early Life Health Interventions {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60% }
![](/figures/LBW_RD.png)
:::

::: {.column width=40%}

- A "jump" in outcomes at 1500g.
- Those just under cut-off receive extra care at birth.
- Under weak assumptions, the size of the jump is a causal effect.

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
**Regression discontinuity**
:::
:::

:::

::::

## Four Methods of Causal Inference {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Experiments
  - e.g. Perry Preschool Intervention, Moving to Opportunity, Audit Studies
- Difference in differences/Event Studies/Other
  - e.g. Minimum wage (Card \& Krueger 1994), early childhood policies on long-run outcomes.
- Regression Discontinuity
  - e.g. Exp. on Infant Health Care (Almond et al 2010), effect of welfare on criminal activity
- Instrumental Variables
  - e.g. Returns to schooling, effect of incarceration on labor market outcomes, effect of school expenditure on student outcomes
::: 

## Key Learning Goals
For each method we must:

::: {.incremental}
- Articulate **clear assumptions** under which method provides valid inference 
- Work from model to **sampling theory** as data grows 
- Use this to test significance of parameter estimates 
- And to derive precision of magnitudes 
- In order to conduct robust/responsible empirical work, we must master theory
