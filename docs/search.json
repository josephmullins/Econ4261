    "section": "Simulation",
    "text": "Simulation\nOne useful way to use R is to explore the basic theoretical predictions of statistics. For example, recall that if a sequence random variables \\(X_{1},...,X_{N}\\) is drawn iid with finite variance, then as \\(N\\) goes to infinity, the central limit theorem gives a formula for the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\\[ \\frac{(\\overline{X}_{N} - \\mu)}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}} \\rightarrow_{d} \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean of \\(X\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the population variance.\nGiven a distribution for \\(X\\), we can easily draw a sample of size \\(N\\). For example, if \\(X\\) is uniform on the interval \\([0,1]\\), the function runif will simulate \\(N\\) draws from this distribution:\n\nsample_X = runif(1000) #&lt;- \n\nTo check this works, let’s look at this histogram:\n\nhist(sample_X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee? Uniform! We will learn more plotting tricks next week.\nRemember, the CLT only tells us about the distribution of the sample mean from a sample of size \\(N\\), which we can only mimic by repeatedly drawing different samples of size \\(N\\). Here is a function to do that when X is uniform.\n\nmontecarlo_u &lt;- function(N,B) {\n  sample_mean = matrix(0,B) #&lt;- the realization for each sample of size N will be stored in this vector\n  for (b in 1:B) {\n    X = runif(N)\n    sample_mean[b] = mean(X)\n  }\n  sample_mean\n}\n\nThis function will take \\(B\\) draws of the sample mean from a sample of size \\(N\\). It uses a for loop, which is a nice way to repeat the same task over and over again. Here we can use is to “simulate” draws from the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The law of large numbers tells us that if we want to know the properties of this sampling distribution, we can learn them arbitrarily well as \\(B\\rightarrow\\infty\\). This is known as a “monte-carlo” simulation. In practice, a value of \\(B=1000\\) (i.e. 200 draws of the sample of size \\(N\\)) will be enough to see what we want to see.\nTo see the central limit theorem at work, let’s look at the sampling distribution of the sample mean when \\(N=2,5,10,50,100\\):\n\nfor (N in c(2,5,10,50,100)) {\n  mc &lt;- montecarlo_u(N,1000)\n  hist(mc,breaks=30)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see this distribution of the sample mean getting more and more “bell-shaped” while also getting more tightly distributed around the true mean (0.5 in this case)."

    "text": "Testing a confidence interval\nRecall that a confidence interval is designed to “contain” the estimand of interest with a fixed probability. We can test whether a confidence interval has the desired properties using monte-carlo simulation. Taking our previous assumptions on \\(X\\) as given, the following code constructs a 95% confidence interval for the population mean of \\(X\\) for each of \\(B\\) samples of size \\(N\\). To get the critical value \\(z_{0.025}\\) we use the function \\(qnorm\\) which gives the quantiles of the normal.\n\nzcrit = qnorm(0.975)\n\nmontecarlo_ci &lt;- function(B,N) {\n  ci = matrix(0,B,2) #&lt;- we will store the lower bound for the CI in the first column, and the upper bound in the second column\n  for (b in 1:B) {\n    X = runif(N)\n    mX = mean(X) #&lt;- sample mean\n    sX = sd(X) #&lt;- sample standard deviation\n    ci[b,1] = mX - zcrit*sX/sqrt(N)\n    ci[b,2] = mX + zcrit*sX/sqrt(N)\n  }\n  ci\n}\n\nHow well does the confidence interval work when \\(N=5\\)? We can run a monte-carlo simulation with \\(B=1000\\) to see how often the confidence interval contains the population mean (remenber that \\(E[X]=0.5\\) if \\(X\\) is uniform on \\([0,1]\\).)\n\nci = montecarlo_ci(1000,5)\ncoverage = mean(ci[,1]&lt;0.5 & ci[,2]&gt;0.5)\nprint(coverage)\n\n[1] 0.88\n\n\nSo we see that the approximation is not working well for this small sample size, and the confidence interval does not contain the mean 95% of the time. Let’s see how it does now as we increase the sample size:\n\nfor (N in c(5,10,50,100,1000)) {\n  ci = montecarlo_ci(1000,N)\n  coverage = mean(ci[,1]&lt;0.5 & ci[,2]&gt;0.5)\n  print(paste(\"For sample size \",N,\" coverage is \",coverage))\n}\n\n[1] \"For sample size  5  coverage is  0.864\"\n[1] \"For sample size  10  coverage is  0.922\"\n[1] \"For sample size  50  coverage is  0.948\"\n[1] \"For sample size  100  coverage is  0.956\"\n[1] \"For sample size  1000  coverage is  0.943\""

Econometrics is a discipline that studies how to test and quantify these theories. It draws from probability, statistics and economics in equal measures to achieve this.\nIn this course you will learn the most important econometric tools both in theory and practice by working with data in the R programming language. We will emphasize throughout the importance of economic theory when interpreting data.\nIt is important to highlight that this is a mathematics and statistics intensive course and students should be comfortable with the material in the enrollment prerequisites (Econ 3101, Math 1271/2, Math 2243, Math 2263, Stat 4/5101/2)."

Hint: you can use what we did with the NLSY in recitation, although you will have to change the steps slightly because a different event-time dummy is omitted here (i.e. a different reference time period is used to normalize \\(\\alpha\\)).\n2 - Plot your event-study estimates in a similar style to Figure (1) in the paper.\n3 - Repeat your analysis for earnings separately by college education (as well as by gender), using the dummy variable college. Comment briefly on your findings relative to question (1)."

What are the advantages of the former over the latter? You can be brief here (2-3 sentences).\n3 - What is the main disadvantage of the combined ACS/CPS dataset relative to the PSID/NLSY? How does the author overcome this technical challenge? How do they validate their approach? You should not need more than a paragraph here."

    "text": "1 - Introduction\nThis Homework is based on the paper: The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States, AER (2013), as in your Week 12 recitation.\nThe authors begin by proposing a simple measure of the growth China’s local import penetration into a local market \\(i\\) in the US:\n\\[ \\Delta IPW_{uit} =  \\sum_{j}\\frac{L_{ijt}}{L_{ujt}}\\frac{\\Delta M_{ucjt}}{L_{it}} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta M_{ucjt}\\) is the growth in overall imports from China to the US in industry \\(j\\)\n\\(L_{it}\\) is total employment in local labor market \\(i\\) at the start of period \\(t\\)\n\\(L_{ijt}\\) is total employment in market \\(i\\) in industry \\(j\\) at the start of period \\(t\\)\n\\(L_{ujt}\\) is total employment in the US in industry \\(j\\) at the start of period \\(t\\)\n\nThe authors estimate a series of specifications of the form:\n\\[ \\Delta Y_{it} = \\gamma_{t} + \\beta_{1}\\Delta IPW_{uit} + \\mathbf{X}_{it}'\\beta_{2} + e_{it} \\]\nwhere \\(Y\\) are the outcomes of interest. To isolate the portion of the change in import competition that is due to the supply side, the authors construct an instrumental variable:\n\\[ \\Delta IPW_{oit} = \\sum_{j}\\frac{L_{ijt-1}}{L_{ujt-1}}\\frac{\\Delta M_{oct}}{L_{it-1}} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta M_{oct}\\) is the change in China’s exports to other high income countries.\n\\(L_{ijt-1}\\) is lagged employment and so on.\n\nRecall the following from recitation:\n\nchange in manufacturing is given by the variable d_sh_empl_mfg\nthe change in import exposure is d_tradeusch_pw\nthe predicted change given global trends (the instrument) is d_tradeotch_pw_lag\nlocal labor markets are defined at the commuting zone level, and so each observation in the regressions is weighted using population share of the CZ, given by timepwt48\nstandard errors are clustered by state level\nOther control variables that you may need are explained in Recitation, or listed below.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\nReproduce Figure 2 Panel B from the paper (in the same way that we replicated Panel A in recitation).\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nUse the fixest package to replicate the estimates from Column (6) of Table 3. Some notes on additional variables you will need (beyond what you saw in recitation):\n\n\nl_sh_routine33 is the percentage of employment in routine occupations\nl_task_outsource is the average offshoreability of occupations in the CZ at the beginning of the period.\n\n\nBy reading the paper, briefly explain the logic of including the perecnt of employment in routine occupations and the average measure of offshoreability.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nReplicate the analysis in Table 4, Panel (C), in the first three columns. The additional variables you will need are:\n\n\nlnchg_popworkage: log change in the working age population\nlnchg_popworkage_edu_c: log change in the working age population with college education\nlnchg_popworkage_edu_nc: log change in the working age population without a college education\n\n\nList one of the three potential explanations for the fact that there does not appear to be a response in population flows to import penetration.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\nReplicate the findings presented in Columns (5) and (6) in Table 7. You will need the additional variables:\n\n\nlnchg_no_empl_nmfg_edu_c: log change in total non-manufacturing employment for college educated works.\nlnchg_no_empl_nmfg_edu_nc: log change in total non-manufacturing employment for non-college educated works.\nd_avg_lnwkwage_nmfg_c: average change in log weekly earnings for college educated workers in non-manufacturing jobs\nd_avg_lnwkwage_nmfg_nc: average change in log weekly earnings for non-college educated workers in non-manufacturing jobs\n\n\nHow do the authors interpret the fact that import penetration appears to have a negative impact on wages in the non-manufacturing sector?"
